- This project contains a simple Rust program that creates a file in /tmp/ and
  appends a message to the file every minute so you can tell that the program
  is still working.

- This project can be built with `cargo build --release`.

- This project contains a systemd service file called "touch-tmp.service" which
  can be copied to /etc/systemd/system/ to be used by systemd.

- To enable the service run:

> sudo systemctl daemon-reload
> sudo systemctl enable touch-tmp.service
> sudo systemctl start touch-tmp.service


- To check that the new service is running, run:

> sudo systemctl status touch-tmp.service

- You can also run:

> journalctl -u touch-tmp.service

  to see that the program is printing to standard out. You should also be able
  to inspect the contents of your file "hello.txt" in /tmp/ to see that the
  program is working.

- As proof that my systemd service file is working, I killed WSL by running
 
> wsl --shutdown
  
  in Powershell. I then restarted Ubuntu and checked on the status of my service:

whowe1@DESKTOP-ET9NNLC:~$ sudo systemctl status touch-tmp.service
[sudo] password for whowe1:

which proves that my service started up on boot!
